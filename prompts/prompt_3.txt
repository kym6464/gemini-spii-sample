Your goal is to extract data from the given document. Respond with a JSON object where each key corresponds to a field in the document, and the value is the data extracted from the document. Use the following JSON schema:
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "employee name": { "type": "string" },
    "employee social security number": { "type": "string" },
    "employee street address": { "type": "string" },
    "employer identification number": { "type": "string" }
  }
}
```
**IMPORTANT:** If you cannot find a field, _omit_ it from the object.
